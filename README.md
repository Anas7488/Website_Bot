1. Introduction
The NeoTech Institute Chatbot is a web-based application designed to enhance communication and information dissemination for prospective and current students, and general visitors of NeoTech Institute. This chatbot acts as an AI-powered virtual assistant, providing instant, accessible, and accurate answers to frequently asked questions, thereby improving user experience and reducing the administrative workload.

Built with Python's Flask framework, the chatbot leverages a hybrid approach, combining predefined static responses with dynamic answers generated by an advanced Large Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face. The project also lays the foundation for a comprehensive student management portal with user authentication.

2. Features
Current Features
Interactive Chatbot Interface: A responsive and user-friendly chat widget integrated into the NeoTech Institute website.

Hybrid Response System:

Static Responses: Answers common queries efficiently from responses.json using difflib for approximate matching.

Dynamic AI Responses: Integrates with the Hugging Face Inference API (currently using meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B) for more complex and natural language queries.

Robust Fallback: Gracefully handles AI API failures (e.g., network issues, rate limits) by reverting to static responses or a default message.

General Admission Inquiry Form: A pop-up modal on the homepage for general interest registrations (Name, Email/Phone). Basic validation is included.

Student Authentication System:

Student Sign Up Page (/student_signup): Allows new students to register with their full name, email, password, and select their academic program (fetched dynamically from the database).

Student Login Page (/login): Secure login for registered students.

Student Dashboard (/student_dashboard): A protected page accessible only to logged-in students, displaying basic profile information including their enrolled program.

Session Management: Uses Flask's built-in session capabilities for maintaining user login states securely.

Responsive Design: Website and chat widget are designed to be viewable and functional across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

Future Enhancements
Enhanced Student Agent Capabilities:

Fee Management: Allow students to check their fee status (due, paid, remaining) and potentially submit fees.

Library Access: Display issued books, return dates, and overdue fines.

Assignment Tracker: Provide an overview of upcoming assignments, submission status, and grades.

Attendance Tracking: Enable students to view their class attendance records.

Full MySQL Database Integration: Extend the current database schema and application logic to manage all dynamic student-related data (fees, library transactions, courses, grades, etc.).

Advanced NLP & Fine-Tuning:

Fine-tune the integrated Hugging Face Llama model (or other suitable LLMs) on NeoTech Institute's specific curriculum, policies, and FAQs for highly accurate and domain-specific answers.

Implement advanced NLP techniques like intent recognition, entity extraction, and conversational memory.

Integration with Institute Systems: Establish API connections with existing Student Information Systems (SIS) or Learning Management Systems (LMS) for real-time data synchronization.

Proactive Notifications: Implement automated reminders for important deadlines (fees, assignments) or announcements.

Admin Panel: Develop a web-based interface for institute staff to manage student data, programs, and chatbot content.

Multi-channel Deployment: Expand chatbot availability to other platforms like WhatsApp, Telegram, or a dedicated mobile application.

5. Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed.

MySQL Server installed and running (e.g., via XAMPP).

A Hugging Face account and an API token (with "read" access) for accessing the meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B model. You must accept the model's terms on Hugging Face to use its API.

Database Setup (MySQL)
Create Database and User:
Open your MySQL client (command line or Workbench) and execute the following SQL. Remember to replace 'your_username' and 'your_password' with your desired credentials.

-- Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS neotech_db;

-- Create a new user for the application
CREATE USER 'your_username'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';

-- Grant privileges to the new user on the neotech_db database
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON neotech_db.* TO 'your_username'@'localhost';

-- Apply the changes
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

-- Switch to your new database
USE neotech_db;

Create Tables (programs and students):
Execute these SQL commands to set up your tables. If you've run previous versions, DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ensures a clean slate.

USE neotech_db;

-- Optional: Drop existing tables if they exist (for a clean setup)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS students;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS programs;

-- Create the programs table
CREATE TABLE programs (
    program_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    program_name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    duration_years INT NOT NULL,
    total_fees DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT
);

-- Insert your academic programs
INSERT INTO programs (program_name, duration_years, total_fees, description) VALUES
('Bachelor of Computer Applications', 3, 250000.00, 'A comprehensive undergraduate program in computer applications.'),
('Master of Computer Applications', 2, 180000.00, 'A postgraduate program for advanced computer studies.'),
('MBA', 2, 200000.00, 'Master of Business Administration'),
('B.Com', 3, 150000.00, 'Bachelor of Commerce'),
('BBA', 3, 160000.00, 'Bachelor of Business Administration'),
('B.Tech in Computer Science', 4, 400000.00, 'Undergraduate engineering in CS.');

-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_pk_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_reg_id VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    full_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female', 'Other', 'Prefer not to say'),
    phone_number VARCHAR(20),
    address_line1 VARCHAR(255),
    address_line2 VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(100),
    state VARCHAR(100),
    zip_code VARCHAR(10),
    program_id INT,
    current_academic_year INT,
    enrollment_date DATE DEFAULT (CURRENT_DATE()),
    student_status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Active',

    FOREIGN KEY (program_id) REFERENCES programs(program_id) ON DELETE SET NULL ON UPDATE CASCADE
);

Project Setup
Clone the repository (if applicable) or ensure you have all project files downloaded.

Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.

Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a .env file in the project root directory (next to app.py). Add your Hugging Face API key and optionally your OpenAI API key (if you revert to OpenAI as primary or plan to use it as an alternative):

HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY="hf_YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN"
# OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" # Uncomment if needed

Replace hf_YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN with your actual token.

Place Static Files:

Ensure style.css is in the static/ directory.

Create an img folder inside static/ (static/img/) and place any necessary images (e.g., hero-bg.jpg, about-us.jpg) in there.

Update app.py Database Credentials:
Open app.py and update the app.config section with your MySQL database user and password created in the database setup step:

app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'your_username' # Your MySQL username
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_password' # Your MySQL password

6. Usage
Run the Flask application:

python app.py

The application will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address.

General Chatbot Interaction
On the homepage, click the chat bubble icon at the bottom right to open the chatbot.

Type your questions into the input field and press Enter or click the send button.

The chatbot will respond using either static predefined answers or dynamic responses from the Hugging Face Llama model.

Student Registration (Sign Up)
From the homepage, click the "Student Sign Up" link in the navigation bar.

Fill in your Full Name, Email, Password, and select a Program from the dropdown.

Click "Register". You should receive a success message and be redirected to the login page.

Student Login
From the homepage, click the "Login" link in the navigation bar, or if redirected after signup.

Enter the Email and Password of a registered student.

Click "Login". Upon successful login, you will be directed to the protected Student Dashboard.

General Admission Inquiry
On the homepage, click the "Register for Admission" button (usually in the hero section).

A modal form will pop up. Fill in your Full Name and Email/Phone contact.

Click "Submit Registration". You will receive a success message, and the inquiry details will be printed in your Flask server's console.

7. Troubleshooting
"An error occurred. Please try again later." / Database Errors in Console (e.g., Unknown column 'id'):

This almost always means your MySQL database schema (especially the students table) does not match what the app.py expects.

Solution: Re-run the DROP TABLE IF EXISTS and CREATE TABLE SQL commands provided in the Database Setup section. Ensure the primary key of students is student_pk_id and other columns are correct.

"Database connection failed.":

Verify your app.config['MYSQL_USER'], MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_HOST, and MYSQL_DB values in app.py are correct and match your MySQL setup.

Ensure your MySQL server (and XAMPP if you're using it) is actually running.

Check your MySQL user's privileges for neotech_db.

Hugging Face API Errors in Console (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, API request failed):

401 Unauthorized: Your HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY in .env is missing, incorrect, or the token doesn't have the necessary permissions. Regenerate a new token on Hugging Face.

404 Not Found: The HUGGING_FACE_API_URL for meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B might be incorrect, or the model is not accessible via the Inference API for your token. Double-check the exact API endpoint on the model's Hugging Face page.

General API request failed: Could be network issues, or a temporary problem with the Hugging Face Inference API. Check their status page if available. Also, ensure you have accepted the model's usage terms on the Hugging Face website.

Website styling is broken:

Ensure style.css is correctly placed in the static/ directory.

Ensure all HTML files correctly link to it using {{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}.

flash messages not appearing:

Ensure app.secret_key is set in app.py.

Ensure {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %} block is present in your HTML templates where you expect messages.
